# Title: Hybrid Encryption-Decryption Tool

#### Description  
A robust C-based encryption and decryption tool that combines Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher and Caesar Cipher techniques. This program allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt text files with customizable or randomly generated keys, ensuring a strong layer of security. It supports file input and output, making it a practical solution for managing encrypted text.


### Key Features  

- **Hybrid Encryption:**  
  - Uses a combination of Substitution and Caesar Cipher.  
  - Substitution Cipher encrypts every 6th letter, while Caesar Cipher dynamically shifts others based on character positions.

- **Custom or Random Keys:**  
  - Generate random encryption keys for convenience.  
  - Define custom keys for tailored encryption.

- **File Operations:**  
  - Reads plaintext from a file.  
  - Writes encrypted or decrypted output to another file.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  - Menu-driven options for encryption, decryption, and key customization.  
  - Displays the key mapping for transparency.
